  frameworks:
    description: |
      List of all frameworks to scan. Run kubescape list frameworks with
      the Kubescape CLI to get a list of all frameworks. Either frameworks
      have to be specified or controls.
    required: false
  controls:
    description: |
      List of all controls to scan. Run kubescape list controls with the

      Path to the json file containing exceptions.
    required: false
  format:
    description: |
      Output format.

      Can take one or more formats. To use one format, omit the comma, e.g
      `format: json`. To produce results in multiple formats, separate them with
      a comma: `format: sarif,json`.

      For example, when using `output: "results"` and `format: "sarif,json"`,
      Kubescape will produce 2 files: `results.sarif` and `results.json`. You
      can then use `results.sarif` to publish results to Github Code Scanning
      and `results.json` to suggest automatic fixes.

      Run `kubescape scan -h` to see a list of supported formats.
    required: false
    default: junit
  fixFiles:
    description: |
      Whether Kubescape will automatically fix files or not.

      If enabled, Kubescape will make fixes to the input files. You can then
      use these fixes to open Pull Requests from your CI/CD pipeline.
