# Kubescape action

Run security scans on your Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts as a part of your CI using the Kubescape action. Kubescape scans Kubernetes clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, detecting misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (such as the [NSA-CISA](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubernetes-hardening-guidance-summary-by-armo/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository) , [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/) and [CIS Benchmark](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubescape-adds-cis-benchmark/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository)), software vulnerabilities. 

## Usage

### Scanning with Kubescape

To scan your repository with [Kubescape in your Github workflow](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubescape-now-integrates-with-github-actions/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository), add the following steps to your workflow configuration:

```yaml
name: Kubescape scanning for misconfigurations
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  kubescape:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: kubescape/github-action@main
      continue-on-error: true
      with:
        format: sarif
        outputFile: results
        # # Optional: Specify the Kubescape Portal credentials 
        # account: ${{secrets.KUBESCAPE_ACCOUNT}}
        # accessKey: ${{secrets.KUBESCAPE_ACCESS_KEY}}
        # server: ${{ vars.KUBESCAPE_SERVER }}
        # # Optional: Scan a specific path. Default will scan the whole repository
        # files: "examples/*.yaml"
    - name: Upload Kubescape scan results to Github Code Scanning
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: results.sarif
```

This workflow definition scans your repository with Kubescape and publishes the results to Github.
You can then see the results in the Pull Request that triggered the scan and the _Security → Code scanning_ tab.

### Automatically Suggest Fixes

To make Kubescape automatically suggest fixes to your pull requests by code review, use the following workflow:

```yaml
name: Suggest autofixes with Kubescape for PR by reviews
on:
  pull_request_target:

jobs:
  kubescape-fix-pr-reviews:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
        ref: ${{github.event.pull_request.head.ref}}
        repository: ${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name}}
    - name: Get changed files
      id: changed-files
      uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v35
    - uses: kubescape/github-action@main
      with:
        account: ${{secrets.KUBESCAPE_ACCOUNT}}
        accessKey: ${{secrets.KUBESCAPE_ACCESS_KEY}}
        server: ${{ vars.KUBESCAPE_SERVER }}
        files: ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}
        fixFiles: true
        format: "sarif"
    - name: PR Suggester according to SARIF file
      if: github.event_name == 'pull_request_target'
      uses: HollowMan6/sarif4reviewdog@v1.0.0
      with:
        file: 'results.sarif'
        level: warning
```

The above workflow works by collecting the [SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=sarif) file that kubescape generates. Then, with the help of [HollowMan6/sarif4reviewdog](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sarif-support-for-reviewdog), convert the SARIF file into [RDFormat (Reviewdog Diagnostic Format)](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/tree/master/proto/rdf) and generate reviews using [Reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog).

You can also make Kubescape automatically suggest fixes for the pushes to your main branch by opening new PRs with the following workflow:

```yaml
name: Suggest autofixes with Kubescape for direct commits by PR
on: 
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  kubescape-fix-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    - name: Get changed files
      id: changed-files
      uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v35
    - uses: kubescape/github-action@main
      with:
        account: ${{secrets.KUBESCAPE_ACCOUNT}}
        accessKey: ${{secrets.KUBESCAPE_ACCESS_KEY}}
        server: ${{ vars.KUBESCAPE_SERVER }}
        files: ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}
        fixFiles: true
        format: "sarif"
    - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4
      # Remember to allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
      # https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests
      if: github.event_name != 'pull_request_target'
      with:
        add-paths: |
          *.yaml
        commit-message: "chore: fix K8s misconfigurations"
        title: "[Kubescape] chore: fix K8s misconfigurations"
        body: |
          # What this PR changes

          [Kubescape](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape) has found misconfigurations in the targeted branch. This PR fixes the misconfigurations that have automatic fixes available.

          You may still need to fix misconfigurations that do not have automatic fixes.
        base: ${{ github.head_ref }}
        branch: kubescape-auto-fix-${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}
        delete-branch: true
```

The above workflow works by collecting the changes made directly to the original files. In the example above, a separate step that runs a different action opens the appropriate pull request. Due to how Github works, there are [limitations](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) on running and opening pull requests to forks. The action running in this step is maintained by its respective maintainers, and not the Kubescape team, so you should review its documentation when troubleshooting the process of triggering the workflow run and opening pull requests.

Please note that since Kubescape provides automatic fixes only to the rendered YAML manifests, the workflow above will not produce correct fixes for Helm charts.

The next important thing to note is that Kubescape only fixes the files. It does not open pull requests or generate code reviews on its own.

### Scanning images

The Kubescape Github Action is also able to scan images. But you should be aware that image scanning cannot run in parallel with configuration scanning and file fixing at the moment. If you would like to run both image and configuration scanning, you should define at least two separate steps with the same action but different arguments: one for image scanning and the other for configuration scanning.

To scan a container image with a Kubescape Github Action, use the following workflow definition, keeping in mind that you need to replace `image: "nginx"` with the appropriate image name:

```yaml
name: Kubescape scanning for image vulnerabilities
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  kubescape-scan-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: kubescape/github-action@main
      continue-on-error: true
      with:
        image: nginx
        format: sarif
        outputFile: results.sarif
        # severityThreshold: "critical"
        # # Username for a private registry with the image
        # registryUsername: ${{secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME}}
        # # Password for a private registry with the image
        # registryPassword: ${{secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD}}
        # # Fail at or above the specified vulnerability severity threshold
        # Kubescape Portal credentials
        # account: ${{secrets.KUBESCAPE_ACCOUNT}}
        # accessKey: ${{secrets.KUBESCAPE_ACCESS_KEY}}
        # server: ${{ vars.KUBESCAPE_SERVER }}
    - name: Upload Kubescape scan results to Github Code Scanning
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: results.sarif
```
